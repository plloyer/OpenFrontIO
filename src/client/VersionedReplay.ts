// Versioned app shells let archived games from older builds be replayed after
// their deployment is gone (#4934). Every deploy uploads a fully-rendered
// index-<short-commit>.html next to the hashed assets in the public bucket
// (see update.sh). The API worker serves them on replay.<domain>, with
// replay.<domain>/<gameId> as the canonical URL: the worker resolves the
// archived record's gitCommit and serves the matching shell there, so a
// mismatched replay just navigates to that URL and the shell's build
// simulates the game with the rules it was played under.
